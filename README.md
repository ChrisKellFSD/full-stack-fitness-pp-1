Full Stack Fitness is a personal training/GYM website. It offers various services from personal training, online coacing and health & nutritional food planning. The aim of the website is to show a combination of sound HTML & CSS skills as well as clear design fundamentals with UX/UI design in mind.

## UX
   This website was designed as a single page website with the aim of being clear and concise. It utilises sound user experience design, with a  aim of giving the user all the information it needs without the need of multiple pages.

  **Wireframe**

   Prior to code being writte, I planned out the design and layout of the site using https://www.lucidchart.com/.

   **Design**

   I created the logo for Full Stack Fitness with colours that would contrast well against a black background. I used adobe illustrator to do this.

  **Colour Scheme**

   I used black and a cyan blue as the two main colours for the website. This combined with white for the text colour, really made a website that contrasted well.

  **Typography**

   The fonts I used for this was 'Poppins' for the main headings and 'Lato' for the body of text.

   Fonts were downloaded from https://fonts.google.com/

   I also used icons in the services, signup and footer section.

   Icons were used from https://fontawesome.com/
